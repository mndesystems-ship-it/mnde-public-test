# MNDe Policy Engine Production Specification v1.0

Short name: MNDe PE

Status: Production target specification

Implementation status: Defines the intended production behavior for MNDe PE. The public tester includes an initial deterministic implementation slice under `src/policy-engine/`; this specification remains the target for the complete production policy engine.

Current implementation slice:

- request schema validation
- policy bundle schema validation
- deterministic rule evaluation
- `ALLOW` / `REFUSE` decision output
- reason codes
- `REFUSE` wins conflict resolution
- no matching rule returns `REFUSE`
- invalid input returns `REFUSE`
- basic policy hash
- basic authority chain hash
- basic decision hash
- first authority checks for required and expired authority

Current implementation does not yet include signed policy verification, authority signature verification, revocation checking, threshold signer enforcement, simulation mode, lockdown mode, the extended operator set, or full production conformance vectors. The implemented operator set is `eq`, `neq`, `contains`, `prefix`, `path_prefix`, `exists`, and `missing` (see [Supported Operators](#supported-operators)); every other operator, policy state, and mode named in this specification is a production target, not current behavior.

## Purpose

MNDe PE is the deterministic authority evaluation engine inside MNDe.

It decides whether a requested execution has valid authority before the action reaches a tool.

MNDe PE returns one result:

```text
ALLOW
```

or

```text
REFUSE
```

No warning state.

No soft approval.

No agent override.

No tool override.

## Core Definition

MNDe PE evaluates a canonical execution request against:

- active signed policy
- valid authority chain
- known trust anchors
- current environment facts
- execution constraints

It produces:

- decision
- reason code
- policy hash
- authority chain hash
- decision hash
- replay data

MNDe PE does not execute actions.

MNDe PE does not call tools.

MNDe PE does not infer intent.

MNDe PE does not use AI.

MNDe PE does not repair requests.

MNDe PE does not rewrite policy.

## Core Rule

Nothing executes before `ALLOW`.

Everything else is `REFUSE`.

## System Philosophy

MNDe is not only permission checking.

MNDe proves authority existed before execution.

A normal policy engine asks:

```text
Is this action allowed?
```

MNDe PE asks:

```text
Does valid authority exist for this execution request?
```

That means every decision links to:

- who granted authority
- what authority was granted
- where authority came from
- when authority expires
- which policy used it
- why the request passed or failed

This is the MNDe distinction.

Execution control is the outcome.

Authority is the product.

## Required Inputs

MNDe PE requires one canonical evaluation input.

Request object:

```json
{
  "schema_version": "1.0",
  "request_id": "req_01JZ0000000000000000000000",
  "timestamp": "2026-06-14T15:30:00Z",
  "principal": {
    "principal_id": "user_123",
    "roles": ["operator"]
  },
  "agent": {
    "agent_id": "agent_456",
    "agent_type": "mcp-client",
    "session_id": "sess_789"
  },
  "tool": {
    "tool_server_id": "server_filesystem",
    "tool_name": "delete_file"
  },
  "parameters": {
    "path": "/tmp/cache.txt"
  },
  "environment": {
    "workspace_id": "workspace_prod",
    "environment_name": "production",
    "host_id": "host_001",
    "region": "us-east-1"
  },
  "context": {
    "estimated_cost": 0,
    "risk_label": "destructive"
  }
}
```

Required top-level fields:

- `schema_version`
- `request_id`
- `timestamp`
- `principal`
- `agent`
- `tool`
- `parameters`
- `environment`
- `context`

Missing required field returns:

```text
REFUSE
INVALID_REQUEST
```

## Required Outputs

Decision object:

```json
{
  "schema_version": "1.0",
  "decision": "REFUSE",
  "reason_code": "RESOURCE_SCOPE_DENIED",
  "request_id": "req_01JZ0000000000000000000000",
  "policy_id": "policy_prod_001",
  "policy_version": "1.4.2",
  "policy_hash": "sha256:...",
  "authority_chain_hash": "sha256:...",
  "decision_hash": "sha256:...",
  "evaluated_at": "2026-06-14T15:30:00Z"
}
```

Valid decisions:

- `ALLOW`
- `REFUSE`

Invalid decision state is forbidden.

## Evaluation Order

MNDe PE evaluates in strict order:

1. Parse request.
2. Validate request schema.
3. Canonicalize request.
4. Load active policy bundle.
5. Validate policy schema.
6. Verify policy signature.
7. Validate trust anchor.
8. Validate authority chain.
9. Check authority expiry.
10. Check revocation state.
11. Evaluate policy constraints.
12. Match rules.
13. Resolve conflicts.
14. Generate decision.
15. Generate hashes.
16. Emit receipt data.

First hard failure wins.

All internal errors return:

```text
REFUSE
FAIL_CLOSED
```

## Canonicalization

All PE inputs must become canonical bytes before hashing.

Canonicalization rules:

- UTF-8 only
- sorted object keys
- no duplicate keys
- no floating point values
- no implicit nulls
- no comments
- no trailing commas
- no platform-specific paths without normalization
- timestamps in RFC 3339 UTC
- integers only for numeric values
- strings preserved exactly after validation

Duplicate key returns:

```text
REFUSE
INVALID_CANONICAL_FORM
```

Canonical request hash:

```text
sha256(canonical_request_bytes)
```

Policy hash:

```text
sha256(canonical_policy_bundle_bytes)
```

Authority chain hash:

```text
sha256(canonical_authority_chain_bytes)
```

Decision hash:

```text
sha256(canonical_decision_material)
```

Decision material includes:

- `request_hash`
- `policy_hash`
- `authority_chain_hash`
- `decision`
- `reason_code`
- `evaluated_at`

## Policy Bundle

Policy bundle structure:

```json
{
  "schema_version": "1.0",
  "policy_id": "policy_prod_001",
  "version": "1.4.2",
  "state": "ACTIVE",
  "created_at": "2026-06-01T00:00:00Z",
  "valid_from": "2026-06-01T00:00:00Z",
  "valid_until": "2026-12-01T00:00:00Z",
  "rules": [],
  "limits": {
    "max_rules": 10000,
    "max_depth": 8,
    "max_policy_bytes": 1048576,
    "max_eval_ms": 25
  },
  "signatures": [],
  "required_signers": {
    "mode": "threshold",
    "threshold": 2,
    "eligible_authorities": [
      "security_authority",
      "platform_authority",
      "root_authority"
    ]
  }
}
```

Allowed states:

- `DRAFT`
- `ACTIVE`
- `REVOKED`
- `EXPIRED`
- `LOCKDOWN`

Only `ACTIVE` and `LOCKDOWN` evaluate.

**Implemented in current V1:** only `ACTIVE`. The current engine accepts `ACTIVE` policies; any other state value returns `REFUSE` / `INVALID_POLICY`. **Planned, not implemented in current V1:** the `DRAFT`, `REVOKED`, `EXPIRED`, and `LOCKDOWN` states and their state-specific reason codes below.

`DRAFT` returns:

```text
REFUSE
POLICY_NOT_ACTIVE
```

`REVOKED` returns:

```text
REFUSE
POLICY_REVOKED
```

`EXPIRED` returns:

```text
REFUSE
POLICY_EXPIRED
```

## Lockdown State

**Planned, not implemented in current V1.** The current engine does not implement the `LOCKDOWN` state; a policy in this state is rejected with `REFUSE` / `INVALID_POLICY`. The behavior below is the production target.

`LOCKDOWN` is an emergency mode.

Default behavior:

```text
All requests REFUSE.
```

Only explicit lockdown exceptions pass.

Example:

```json
{
  "state": "LOCKDOWN",
  "lockdown_exceptions": [
    {
      "tool_name": "read_status",
      "effect": "ALLOW"
    }
  ]
}
```

No matching lockdown exception returns:

```text
REFUSE
LOCKDOWN_ACTIVE
```

## Policy Rule Model

Rule structure:

```json
{
  "rule_id": "rule_001",
  "effect": "ALLOW",
  "description": "Allow operators to read service status",
  "match": {
    "all": [
      { "field": "tool.tool_name", "op": "eq", "value": "read_status" },
      { "field": "principal.roles", "op": "contains", "value": "operator" }
    ]
  },
  "authority_required": [
    "status_read_authority"
  ]
}
```

Valid effects:

- `ALLOW`
- `REFUSE`

Invalid effect returns:

```text
REFUSE
INVALID_POLICY
```

## Policy Grammar

Supported logical operators:

- `all`
- `any`
- `not`

Meaning:

- `all` equals AND
- `any` equals OR
- `not` negates one expression

Example:

```json
{
  "all": [
    {
      "any": [
        { "field": "principal.roles", "op": "contains", "value": "admin" },
        { "field": "principal.roles", "op": "contains", "value": "operator" }
      ]
    },
    { "field": "environment.environment_name", "op": "eq", "value": "staging" }
  ]
}
```

Precedence:

1. `not`
2. `all`
3. `any`

Nesting limit:

```text
8 levels by default
```

Exceeded nesting returns:

```text
REFUSE
POLICY_LIMIT_EXCEEDED
```

## Supported Operators

### Implemented in current V1

These operators are implemented in `src/policy-engine/index.mjs` and are the only operators accepted today. Any other operator returns `REFUSE` / `INVALID_POLICY`.

- `eq` — strict equality
- `neq` — strict inequality
- `contains` — array membership (attribute value is an array containing the operand)
- `prefix` — string prefix
- `path_prefix` — normalized path-prefix containment
- `exists` — attribute is present
- `missing` — attribute is absent

Unsupported operator returns:

```text
REFUSE
INVALID_POLICY
```

### Planned, not implemented in current V1

The following operators are production targets. They are not present in the engine today and a policy that uses one is rejected with `REFUSE` / `INVALID_POLICY`.

String operators:

- `suffix`
- `contains_string`

Array operators:

- `contains_all`
- `contains_any`

Numeric operators:

- `lt`
- `lte`
- `gt`
- `gte`

Time operators:

- `before`
- `after`
- `within_window`

Path operators:

- `path_exact`
- `path_denied_prefix`

## Conflict Resolution

`REFUSE` always wins.

Evaluation rule:

1. If any matching `REFUSE` rule exists, decision is `REFUSE`.
2. Else if any matching `ALLOW` rule exists, decision is `ALLOW`.
3. Else decision is `REFUSE`.

No match returns:

```text
REFUSE
NO_MATCHING_RULE
```

## Authority Framework

Authority is a first-class object.

Authority object:

```json
{
  "authority_id": "prod_deploy_authority",
  "authority_type": "execution_scope",
  "issued_by": "platform_authority",
  "issued_to": "ci_agent_001",
  "scope": {
    "tools": ["deploy_service"],
    "environments": ["production"],
    "regions": ["us-east-1"]
  },
  "valid_from": "2026-06-01T00:00:00Z",
  "valid_until": "2026-07-01T00:00:00Z",
  "constraints": {
    "max_runtime_seconds": 600,
    "allowed_hours_utc": {
      "start": "09:00",
      "end": "17:00"
    }
  },
  "signature": {
    "alg": "Ed25519",
    "key_id": "key_platform_001",
    "signature": "..."
  }
}
```

Expired authority returns:

```text
REFUSE
AUTHORITY_EXPIRED
```

Missing authority returns:

```text
REFUSE
AUTHORITY_REQUIRED
```

Invalid authority signature returns:

```text
REFUSE
AUTHORITY_SIGNATURE_INVALID
```

### Binding invariant (enforced)

**A signed authority grant is not a bearer token.** A grant that is validly signed
and in-window satisfies an `authority_required` entry *only* when it is bound to
the exact request being decided. Binding is carried inside the signed `scope`
object (and an optional top-level `nonce`), so it cannot be altered without
breaking the signature. The engine enforces, in order:

| Binding | Grant field | Rule | Reason on mismatch |
|---|---|---|---|
| Subject | `scope.subject` (or `scope.principal`) | required; must equal `principal.id` (falls back to `principal.principal_id`) | `AUTHORITY_SUBJECT_MISMATCH` (missing → `AUTHORITY_UNBOUND`) |
| Tool / action | `scope.tool_name` (or `scope.tool`) | required; must equal `tool.tool_name` or be `"*"` | `AUTHORITY_TOOL_MISMATCH` (missing → `AUTHORITY_UNBOUND`) |
| Tenant | `scope.tenant` | if present must equal `principal.tenant_id`; a tenant-scoped request cannot be satisfied by a tenant-less grant | `AUTHORITY_TENANT_MISMATCH` |
| Resource | `scope.resource` | if present must equal `parameters.resource` or be `"*"` | `AUTHORITY_RESOURCE_MISMATCH` |
| Request (one-shot) | `scope.request_id` | if present must equal `request_id` | `AUTHORITY_REQUEST_MISMATCH` |
| Replay (single-use) | `nonce` | consumed once at the sidecar; a second use is refused | `AUTHORITY_NONCE_REUSED` |

Subject and tool are **mandatory**: a grant that omits them is `AUTHORITY_UNBOUND`
and can never satisfy a requirement. This closes cross-principal / cross-tenant /
cross-tool / cross-resource / cross-request replay of a stolen grant (grants are
disclosed inside every receipt, so they must not be reusable).

Subject/tenant/tool/resource/request bindings are **deterministic** and are
re-checked during offline receipt verification and replay. Nonce single-use is a
**runtime** layer (a pure, replayable function cannot consume a nonce); it is
enforced at the sidecar via `src/policy-engine/grant-nonce-store.mjs`, backed by
`MNDE_PE_GRANT_NONCE_DIR` for cross-process durability. A nonce-reuse refusal
rebuilds the decision without the consumed grant, so the emitted REFUSE receipt
still verifies offline.

**Compatibility:** grants issued before this invariant carried no `scope` and are
now `AUTHORITY_UNBOUND` — they no longer satisfy authority requirements, and any
prior ALLOW receipt that depended on an unbound grant will replay as REFUSE (fail
closed). Re-issue grants with a bound `scope`. The `issued_to` field and the
array-shaped `scope.tools`/`environments`/`regions` shown above remain
informational and are **not** yet enforced (tracked for V1.1).

## Authority Chain

Authority chain example:

```json
{
  "chain": [
    {
      "authority_id": "root_authority",
      "issued_to": "security_authority"
    },
    {
      "authority_id": "security_authority",
      "issued_to": "platform_authority"
    },
    {
      "authority_id": "platform_authority",
      "issued_to": "ci_agent_001"
    }
  ]
}
```

Every link must verify.

Broken chain returns:

```text
REFUSE
AUTHORITY_CHAIN_INVALID
```

Unknown root returns:

```text
REFUSE
TRUST_ANCHOR_UNKNOWN
```

## Delegation

Delegation must be explicit.

Valid delegation requires:

- issuer has delegation authority
- recipient is named
- scope is narrower or equal
- expiry is equal or shorter
- signature is valid

A delegate cannot grant more authority than it received.

Scope expansion returns:

```text
REFUSE
AUTHORITY_SCOPE_ESCALATION
```

## Authority Expiry

Authority expiry is separate from policy expiry.

Policy may remain active while authority expires.

Expired authority is treated as nonexistent.

Result:

```text
REFUSE
AUTHORITY_EXPIRED
```

## Authority Provenance

Every decision records authority provenance.

Required fields:

- `root_authority_id`
- `signing_authority_id`
- `policy_signer_ids`
- `authority_chain_hash`
- `authority_version`
- `authority_origin`

Purpose:

```text
Prove where execution authority came from.
```

## Authority Debt

Authority debt is audit-only.

It never changes `ALLOW` or `REFUSE`.

Authority debt metrics:

- `temporary_exception_count`
- `wildcard_permission_count`
- `orphaned_authority_count`
- `expired_authority_count`
- `broad_scope_authority_count`
- `manual_override_count`
- `lockdown_exception_count`

Example:

```json
{
  "authority_debt": {
    "temporary_exception_count": 2,
    "wildcard_permission_count": 1,
    "orphaned_authority_count": 0,
    "expired_authority_count": 0,
    "broad_scope_authority_count": 3,
    "manual_override_count": 0,
    "lockdown_exception_count": 1
  }
}
```

This gives MNDe a governance signal without corrupting deterministic enforcement.

## Trust Anchor Model

Trust anchor object:

```json
{
  "trust_anchor_id": "root_authority",
  "key_id": "root_key_001",
  "public_key": "...",
  "alg": "Ed25519",
  "valid_from": "2026-01-01T00:00:00Z",
  "valid_until": "2028-01-01T00:00:00Z",
  "state": "ACTIVE"
}
```

Allowed trust anchor states:

- `ACTIVE`
- `REVOKED`
- `EXPIRED`

Revoked root returns:

```text
REFUSE
TRUST_ANCHOR_REVOKED
```

## Signing

Required algorithm for v1:

```text
Ed25519
```

Signature envelope:

```json
{
  "alg": "Ed25519",
  "key_id": "key_security_001",
  "signed_at": "2026-06-14T15:30:00Z",
  "signature": "..."
}
```

Policy activation requires valid signatures.

**Threshold signer enforcement is planned, not implemented in current V1.** The current engine does not enforce a multi-signer signature threshold; the threshold examples and the `POLICY_SIGNATURE_THRESHOLD_NOT_MET` reason code below are a production target.

Threshold examples:

- 1 of 1
- 2 of 2
- 2 of 3

Failed threshold returns:

```text
REFUSE
POLICY_SIGNATURE_THRESHOLD_NOT_MET
```

## Revocation

Revocation lists apply to:

- policies
- authority objects
- signing keys
- trust anchors
- agents
- sessions

Revocation object:

```json
{
  "revoked_id": "prod_deploy_authority",
  "revoked_type": "authority",
  "revoked_at": "2026-06-14T15:00:00Z",
  "reason": "scope retired",
  "signed_by": "security_authority"
}
```

Revoked authority returns:

```text
REFUSE
AUTHORITY_REVOKED
```

## Request Attribute Model

Allowed attribute roots:

- `principal`
- `agent`
- `tool`
- `parameters`
- `environment`
- `context`

Unknown root in policy returns:

```text
REFUSE
INVALID_POLICY
```

Unknown field in request evaluation returns:

```text
REFUSE
ATTRIBUTE_MISSING
```

Unless the rule uses:

```text
missing
```

## Dangerous Defaults

Forbidden defaults:

- allow by default
- trust unknown principal
- trust unknown agent
- trust unsigned policy
- trust stale authority
- trust unbounded wildcard
- ignore missing field
- ignore unknown operator
- ignore invalid timestamp

Any one returns `REFUSE`.

## Wildcards

Wildcards are allowed only when explicitly enabled in policy metadata.

Example:

```json
{
  "wildcards_enabled": false
}
```

Wildcard used while disabled returns:

```text
REFUSE
WILDCARD_DENIED
```

Wildcard usage increases authority debt.

## Expensive Risk Controls

These cover the expensive failures.

Bypass risk:

```text
PE records tool_server_id, agent_id, session_id, policy_hash, authority_chain_hash.
```

Tampering risk:

```text
All inputs hash before decision.
```

Stale policy risk:

```text
Policy has valid_from and valid_until.
```

Compromised signer risk:

```text
Revocation list and threshold signatures.
```

Overbroad access risk:

```text
Authority debt metrics.
```

Bad rollout risk:

```text
Simulation required before activation.
```

Emergency risk:

```text
LOCKDOWN state.
```

Policy abuse risk:

```text
Rule count, depth, size, and evaluation time limits.
```

Replay dispute risk:

```text
Receipts include all hashes needed for offline verification.
```

## Evaluation Limits

Default limits:

- `max_rules`: 10000
- `max_depth`: 8
- `max_policy_bytes`: 1048576
- `max_eval_ms`: 25
- `max_authority_chain_length`: 10
- `max_signatures`: 10

Limit exceeded returns:

```text
REFUSE
LIMIT_EXCEEDED
```

## Policy Simulation

**Planned, not implemented in current V1.** The current engine does not provide a simulation mode. The behavior below is the production target.

Simulation evaluates without execution.

Simulation output:

- decision
- matching rules
- refuse rules
- authority chain
- reason code
- authority debt impact
- policy hash

Simulation never writes execution receipts.

Simulation result is not execution authority.

## Replay

Replay verifies:

- request canonical hash
- policy canonical hash
- authority chain hash
- decision hash
- policy signatures
- authority signatures
- reason code
- decision result

Replay result:

```text
PASS
FAIL
```

Replay `PASS` means the decision reproduced exactly.

## Receipt Material

PE produces receipt material for MNDe ERS.

Minimum receipt fields:

- `request_id`
- `request_hash`
- `decision`
- `reason_code`
- `policy_id`
- `policy_version`
- `policy_hash`
- `authority_chain_hash`
- `decision_hash`
- `evaluated_at`
- `engine_version`
- `signature`

## Error Behavior

All errors collapse to `REFUSE`.

Malformed request:

```text
REFUSE
INVALID_REQUEST
```

Malformed policy:

```text
REFUSE
INVALID_POLICY
```

Internal crash:

```text
REFUSE
FAIL_CLOSED
```

Timeout:

```text
REFUSE
EVALUATION_TIMEOUT
```

Unknown signer:

```text
REFUSE
SIGNER_UNKNOWN
```

## Versioning

Schema versioning rules:

- patch versions fix wording or test vectors
- minor versions add fields without changing decisions
- major versions alter evaluation behavior

No silent behavior changes.

Policy bundle must declare compatible PE versions.

Example:

```json
{
  "requires_pe": ">=1.0 <2.0"
}
```

Unsupported version returns:

```text
REFUSE
UNSUPPORTED_POLICY_VERSION
```

## Non-Goals

MNDe PE does not:

- execute tools
- store long-term audit logs
- manage users
- create policy
- interpret natural language
- rank risk with AI
- replace IAM
- replace SIEM
- replace KMS
- replace MCP
- repair broken configs
- permit emergency bypass without signed authority

## Production Acceptance Criteria

MNDe PE reaches production-ready v1 when it has:

- formal request schema
- formal policy schema
- formal authority object schema
- canonicalization implementation
- signed policy verification
- authority chain verification
- revocation checking
- deterministic rule evaluator
- conflict resolution
- fail-closed behavior
- evaluation limits
- replay verification
- receipt material output
- conformance tests
- known test vectors
- simulation mode
- lockdown mode

## Required Test Vectors

Minimum production test set:

- `ALLOW` simple `read_status`
- `REFUSE` `recursive_delete`
- `REFUSE` no matching rule
- `REFUSE` invalid request
- `REFUSE` unsigned policy
- `REFUSE` expired policy
- `REFUSE` revoked policy
- `REFUSE` expired authority
- `REFUSE` broken authority chain
- `REFUSE` invalid signature
- `REFUSE` wildcard denied
- `REFUSE` policy limit exceeded
- `REFUSE` lockdown active
- `ALLOW` lockdown exception
- `ALLOW` threshold signatures met
- `REFUSE` threshold signatures missing
- replay `PASS` unchanged receipt
- replay `FAIL` tampered request
- replay `FAIL` tampered policy
- replay `FAIL` tampered authority chain

## Final Production Definition

MNDe PE is a deterministic authority evaluation engine for pre-execution control.

It evaluates canonical execution requests against signed policy and valid authority chains.

It returns `ALLOW` only when valid authority exists.

It returns `REFUSE` for everything else.

It produces replayable proof tied to the request, policy, authority chain, and decision.

MNDe PE does not decide what happened after execution.

MNDe PE decides whether execution had authority before it began.

```text
Authority first. Execution second. Proof always.
```

## Receipts and unified verification

A MNDe PE decision is wrapped into a signed receipt (`mnde.pe.receipt.v1`) on the
same Ed25519 authority chain as every other MNDe receipt — the same signing key,
the same signed authority manifest, the same verification primitives.

```bash
# Evaluate a request against a policy and emit a signed receipt:
mnde decide --request request.json --policy policy.json --out receipt.json

# One verifier checks any MNDe receipt, regardless of producer:
npm run verify receipt.json          # policy-engine receipt
npm run verify path/to/legacy.json   # legacy pipeline receipt (ecs.receipt.v2)
```

Verification of a PE receipt replays the decision by re-running the deterministic
engine on the embedded request, policy, and authorities, then checks the signature
against the trusted authority manifest. A tampered request, policy, or decision
fails closed.

This unifies the trust surface: the policy engine and the receipt/verification
system share one authority chain and one verifier. The legacy pipeline receipts
remain verifiable unchanged; the policy engine is the canonical decision producer
going forward.

## Cryptographic authority chain

When the caller supplies trust anchors, MNDe PE requires cryptographic proof of authority, not just validity windows:

- the **policy** must carry an Ed25519 signature from a key in `trust_anchors.policy_keys`;
- each **authority grant** counted toward `authority_required` must carry an Ed25519 signature from a key in `trust_anchors.authority_keys` (and within the issuer key's validity window, if set).

Trust anchors are supplied by the verifier out of band — never read from the policy, request, or receipt. Distinct fail-closed reason codes: `POLICY_UNSIGNED`, `POLICY_UNTRUSTED_ISSUER`, `POLICY_SIGNATURE_INVALID`, `AUTHORITY_UNSIGNED`, `AUTHORITY_UNTRUSTED_ISSUER`, `AUTHORITY_SIGNATURE_INVALID`.

```bash
# Sign a policy / grant with policy-engine signing helpers (src/policy-engine/trust.mjs),
# then evaluate and verify under a trust anchor set:
mnde decide --request request.json --policy signed-policy.json \
  --authorities signed-grants.json --trust-anchors trust-anchors.json --out receipt.json
npm run verify receipt.json --trust-anchors trust-anchors.json
```

A receipt produced under a trust anchor set is `trust_enforced: true` and can only be verified by a verifier that supplies trust anchors; a verifier with the wrong anchors does not accept it. Without trust anchors the engine behaves as a pure rule evaluator (unchanged), so existing behavior and tests are byte-for-byte preserved.

## Authenticated approvals

Beyond signed policy and signed authority grants, MNDe PE can require a signed,
in-scope, unexpired **approval** from a trusted issuer where a policy rule asks
for it. A verifier can later answer: who requested the action, who approved it,
who issued the approval, whether that issuer was trusted, and whether the
approval was valid at decision time.

An approval artifact carries `approval_id`, `approver`, `issuer`, `issued_at`,
`expires_at`, `scope` (`{ tool_name, request_id? }`), and an Ed25519 `signature`.
A policy rule opts in with `approval_required` (a count; `true` means one).

Approval trust anchors are supplied by the verifier OUT OF BAND — never read from
the policy, request, or receipt:

```
approvalTrustAnchors = { approval_keys: [{ key_id, public_key (PEM), valid_from?, valid_until? }] }
```

Verification requires: a valid signature from a trusted issuer key, within the
approval's validity window, with a scope that matches the requested action, and
enough valid approvals to meet the rule's count. Fail-closed reason codes:
`APPROVAL_REQUIRED`, `APPROVAL_MISSING`, `APPROVAL_MALFORMED`, `APPROVAL_EXPIRED`,
`APPROVAL_NOT_YET_VALID`, `APPROVAL_SCOPE_MISMATCH`, `APPROVAL_UNSIGNED`,
`APPROVAL_UNTRUSTED_ISSUER`, `APPROVAL_SIGNATURE_INVALID`, `APPROVAL_IDENTITY_INVALID`.

```bash
mnde decide --request req.json --policy policy.json --authorities grants.json \
  --approvals approvals.json --trust-anchors anchors.json \
  --approval-trust-anchors approval-anchors.json --out receipt.json
npm run verify receipt.json --approval-trust-anchors approval-anchors.json
```

A receipt produced under approval enforcement is `approval_enforced: true` and
records, per approval, the approver, issuer, approval id, validity window, and
verification result. It can only be verified by a verifier that supplies approval
trust anchors; a verifier with the wrong anchors does not accept it. With no
approval trust anchors the engine is unchanged and `approval_required` has no
effect, so existing behavior and tests are byte-for-byte preserved.

## Decision Engine Modes

The sidecar supports two decision engines, selected by `MNDE_DECISION_ENGINE`:

- `policy-engine` (default) — `/v1/decisions` (and therefore the MCP proxy and
  executor) route through the policy engine and return a signed
  `mnde.pe.receipt.v1` receipt that verifies offline through `npm run verify`.
  All demos and the reviewer kit run this engine by default, deciding against
  `examples/policy-engine/sample-policy.json` when no policy is configured.
- `legacy` (explicit opt-in) — the compatibility pipeline. Unchanged and
  byte-for-byte compatible; the policy-engine adapter is not even loaded.

Policy-engine mode configuration (sidecar/env/flag only — never the request body):

| Variable | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `MNDE_DECISION_ENGINE=policy-engine` | enable the policy-engine path |
| `MNDE_PE_POLICY` | path to the active policy (unset → the built-in default-deny policy is active and every decision REFUSES) |
| `MNDE_PE_TRUST_ANCHORS` | policy/authority trust anchors (optional; enables the cryptographic authority chain) |
| `MNDE_PE_APPROVAL_TRUST_ANCHORS` | approval trust anchors (optional; enables authenticated approvals) |

Signed artifacts (authority grants, approvals) may be attached to the request as
`mnde_authorities` / `mnde_approvals`. **Trust anchors are never read from the
request body** — only from the configuration above.

```bash
npm run reviewer-kit           # one-command policy-engine proof path
npm run reviewer-kit:pe        # minimal ALLOW/REFUSE policy-engine check
```

Fail-closed guarantees in policy-engine mode: a malformed or missing configured
file (`ERR_PE_CONFIG_INVALID`), an engine error (`ERR_PE_DECISION_FAILED`),
invalid signatures, bad/expired approvals, or unmatched rules all REFUSE. A
REFUSE is never forwarded by the proxy.

**Caveat:** these policy-engine guarantees apply to live traffic only under the
default `policy-engine` engine. When `MNDE_DECISION_ENGINE=legacy` is set
explicitly, the compatibility pipeline decides and the policy-engine path is
inactive.

## Sidecar Caller Authentication

The sidecar can authenticate the caller of `/v1/decisions`, selected by
`MNDE_SIDECAR_AUTH`:

- `off` (default) — unauthenticated, legacy-compatible. Unchanged.
- `bearer` (opt-in) — requires `Authorization: Bearer <token>`. The token is
  validated against configuration only; the caller identity is the configured
  token label, and is mapped into the policy-engine `principal`.

Configuration (env/file only — never the request body):

| Variable | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `MNDE_SIDECAR_AUTH=bearer` | enable bearer authentication |
| `MNDE_SIDECAR_AUTH_TOKENS` | JSON object `{ "<token>": "<caller_id>" }` |
| `MNDE_SIDECAR_AUTH_TOKENS_FILE` | path to the same JSON (alternative to the env var) |

```bash
MNDE_SIDECAR_AUTH=bearer \
MNDE_SIDECAR_AUTH_TOKENS='{"local-pilot-token":"pilot-caller"}' \
MNDE_DECISION_ENGINE=policy-engine \
MNDE_PE_POLICY=examples/policy-engine/sample-policy.json \
  npm run sidecar
```

Guarantees: authentication runs before any decision work. A missing, malformed,
or wrong token returns `401` with `REFUSE` / `ERR_UNAUTHENTICATED` and **no
receipt** — an unauthenticated caller never reaches evaluation and never receives
an ALLOW receipt. The MCP proxy does not forward an unauthenticated call. Tokens
and identities are configuration and are never written into receipts. Works in
both legacy and policy-engine decision modes.

**Caveat:** bearer tokens are for local/pilot use. Production should use stronger
caller identity — mTLS, OIDC, or signed client assertions. Note the distinction:
**approvals prove who approved an action; caller authentication proves who asked.**

### Authenticated proxy / executor

The executor (and therefore the MCP server and proxy that use it) sends the
bearer token only when one is configured, via `MNDE_SIDECAR_BEARER_TOKEN`
(or `createMndeExecutor({ bearerToken })`). It is sent solely as the
`Authorization` header on the call to `/v1/decisions`; it is never logged,
stored in receipts, or included in error output.

```bash
# sidecar (terminal 1)
MNDE_SIDECAR_AUTH=bearer \
MNDE_SIDECAR_AUTH_TOKENS='{"local-pilot-token":"pilot-caller"}' \
MNDE_DECISION_ENGINE=policy-engine \
MNDE_PE_POLICY=examples/policy-engine/sample-policy.json \
  npm run sidecar

# proxy in front of an upstream MCP server (terminal 2)
MNDE_SIDECAR_URL=http://127.0.0.1:8787 \
MNDE_SIDECAR_BEARER_TOKEN=local-pilot-token \
MNDE_PROXY_UPSTREAM_COMMAND=node \
MNDE_PROXY_UPSTREAM_ARGS='["/abs/path/to/your-mcp-server.js"]' \
  npm run mcp-proxy
```

Without a token (or with a wrong token) against an auth-enabled sidecar, every
tool call is REFUSED and never forwarded. Bearer mode remains pilot-grade and is
not the final enterprise identity mechanism (use mTLS / OIDC / signed client
assertions in production).
